## ðŸš¨ **Expected Results**

### Grade Calculation Example:
```

Internal Assessments (40%):
â”œâ”€â”€ Quiz 1: 42/50 = 84%
â”œâ”€â”€ Assignment 1: 88/100 = 88%
â”œâ”€â”€ Participation: 23/25 = 92%
â””â”€â”€ Internal Average: 88% Ã— 0.40 = 35.2%

External Assessment (60%):
â””â”€â”€ Final Exam: 135/150 = 90% Ã— 0.60 = 54.0%

Final Grade: 35.2% + 54.0% = 89.2% = B+
Quality Points: 3.3 Ã— 3 credits = 9.9 points
```

### GPA Calculation:
```
Total Quality Points: 9.9 + [other courses]
